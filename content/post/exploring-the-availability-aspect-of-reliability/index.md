When people talk about reliability, they tend to start with availability. Is the
system "up" or is it "down"? Can others reach your website or your service? Can
they use the product when they expect to? This is important from the perspective
of both external customers and internal users who depend on your service. Thus,
availability is a good starting point for discussing reliability, but itâ€™s only
one aspect.
