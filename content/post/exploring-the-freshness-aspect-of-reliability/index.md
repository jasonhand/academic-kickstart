Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information is in situations where
timeliness matters to the customer. Examples would include sports scores or
election results, in which the data is constantly and quickly changing.
Freshness is not a factor for sites with static content that can remain the same
over time, but if your site serves time-sensitive information, customers will
expect that content to be kept current if theyâ€™re to consider the site reliable.
