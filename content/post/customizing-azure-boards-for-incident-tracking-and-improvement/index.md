Now that we have a place to collaborate over incidents, we need to ensure we are tracking all of the important aspects. Such as:

- "When did we know about the problem?"
- "How did we learn of the problem?"
- "Who is aware of the problem?"
- "What is the impact of the problem?"
- "What is being done about the problem?"

Let's now take a look at how we can customize Azure Boards to track these details for us.

## When did we know?

## How did we know?

## Who is aware?

## What is the impact?

## What is being done?


One way of making sure clear and transparent information is shared to others is by [Establishing Communication Channels](/post/measuring-incident-response/) that are to be used during and after an incident.
