Latency refers to the amount of delay between a request and a response. You may
have heard the familiar catchphrase that “slow is the new down.” This refers to
today’s high customer expectations. People demand fast performance and they lose
patience with a site or service that leaves them waiting. Reliability means the
site is not only available, but available *right now* when the customer wants to
use it.

Especially for external customer interactions – for example, when a customer
visits your company’s website – it is critical that the service respond as
quickly as possible. A slow website can drive your customers to your
competitors, so latency is a reliability concern.
