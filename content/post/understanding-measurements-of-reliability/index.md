You can use SLIs and SLOs to set appropriate goals based on the different
aspects of reliability and to determine whether you are meeting those goals,
using simple calculations and a basic recipe. This is an operational practice
you can adopt to create a feedback loop in your organization to improve
reliability. SLIs and SLOs can transform the reliability discussion and bring
about positive culture change within your organization.

In this module thus far, you’ve learned about some useful tools that you can use
to monitor for reliability, and you know how to search and sort the data that
you collect. Now you’ll find out how to actually measure the success of your
reliability efforts using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level
Objectives (SLOs).

-   **Service Level Objectives** are simply the goals that you’ve set, based on
    the *appropriate level of reliability* that you want to reach.

-   **Service Level Indicators** are the measurements that you use to determine
    whether you have reached those goals; in other words, the *indicators* that
    your service is behaving reliably.
