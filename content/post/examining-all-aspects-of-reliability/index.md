There are eight important components that go into determining the reliability of
a system, service, application, or process. Consider whether and how each of
these is applicable in evaluating and improving the reliability of your systems
and services. Keep in mind, however, that reliability should always be measured
from the customer’s perspective, not the component perspective.

Raising your operational awareness and establishing a baseline of reliable
performance helps you to set expectations and recognize deviations from the
norm. After you establish a baseline, you can compare current performance to the
baseline statistics.

To create a baseline, you need to consider the many aspects of reliability that
combine to make up a person’s expectations. Some of these will apply to
particular applications and services but not to others. In all of these cases,
your goal is to understand and work with people’s expectations.

The important takeaway from this unit is this expanded idea of what reliability
means to your customers or internal users. Following are eight important aspects
of reliability to consider as you create your baseline.

- Availability
- Latency
- Throughput
- Coverage
- Correctness
- Fidelity
- Freshness
- Durability
