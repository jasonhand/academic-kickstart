A rotation is a scheduled shift. Engineers takes the “on-call” responsibility for their own specific recurring rotation. There are several types of shifts that you can create – some more common than others.

## 24 x 7

is a rotation where engineers will be “on-call” for several days in a row. However, most “Elite/High performers” would agree that rotations longer than 3 or 4 days are detrimental to the overall health of engineering staff and therefore the entire system.  

## Follow the Sun

Follow the sun shifts are nice for distributed teams. These allow for engineers to schedule their “on-call” shifts only during their normal working office hours. As they end their day and go home, engineers in a different time zone can take over.

And of course, there are many ways to customize shifts, especially for weekends when engineers need more flexibility. Engineers should be able to hand off the role to someone when personal conflicts arise.
