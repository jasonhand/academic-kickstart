Fidelity in this context pertains to the ability of your service to continue to
provide a reduced or degraded experience when something goes wrong. For example,
if different parts of the home page on your website are provided by different
microservices, and one of those microservices goes down, ideally you can still
serve the home page with only that section missing or replaced with some static
content.

Fidelity, then, is the measure of how often the page served that degraded or
partial experience in comparison to serving the full page as intended with full
fidelity.
