Throughput is a measure of the rate at which something is processed, or the
number of transactions that a website, application, or service successfully
handles over a specified period of time. This is particularly important when
running pipelines or batch processing systems. There are many factors that can
affect throughput. Monitoring throughput can help you pinpoint potential
problems that impact your usersâ€™ experience.
