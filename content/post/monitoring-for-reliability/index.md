A reasonable level of operational awareness is necessary to effectively monitor for reliability. Monitoring tools can help measure and improve reliability in
your organization.

You now have an expanded concept of what reliability is. Next, you need to learn
about the role monitoring plays in reaching your reliability goals.

Monitoring is a systematic and routine collection of information about
activities, events, and statuses that you can use to improve practices and make
